# times-table

- Create a program file called task1.py.
- This program needs to make use of for loops in order to display the times tables for any number.
- For example, say the user enters 6 - the program must print out the 6 times table from start (1) to end (12), something like this:
- The 6 times table is:
- 6 x 1 = 6
- 6 x 2 = 12
- â€¦
- 6 x 12 = 72
